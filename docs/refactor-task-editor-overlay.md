# Task Editor Refactoring

## Summary of Changes

The task editor has been refactored from a sidebar-based implementation to an overlay-based approach. This document outlines the changes made during this refactoring process.

## Key Changes

### Component Renaming

- `SidebarComponent` has been renamed to `TaskEditorContainerComponent`
- `SidebarService` has been renamed to `TaskEditorService`
- All related imports and references have been updated throughout the codebase

### UI/UX Changes

- Changed from a sidebar sliding in from the right side to a centered overlay modal
- Added a semi-transparent backdrop to focus attention on the task editor
- Improved accessibility by centering the content in the viewport
- Maintained the same keyboard navigation and shortcut functionality

### Animation Changes

- Updated animation from `slideInOut` to `fadeInOut` to better suit the overlay paradigm
- The overlay now fades in and out with a smooth transition

### HTML/CSS Structure

- Changed from a fixed position sidebar to a centered overlay container
- Added a backdrop element to darken the background when the overlay is active
- Adjusted sizing to ensure the overlay is appropriately sized for all screen sizes

## Files Changed

1. Component Files:

   - Created: `task-editor-container.component.ts`
   - Created: `task-editor-container.component.html`
   - Created: `task-editor-container.component.scss`
   - Created: `task-editor-container.animations.ts`

2. Service Files:

   - Created: `task-editor-container.service.ts`

3. Updated Imports:

   - `main.component.ts` - Updated references to TaskEditorContainerComponent
   - `main.component.html` - Updated component selector
   - `task-editor.component.ts` - Updated service references
   - `task-description.component.ts` - Updated service references
   - `task-card.component.ts` - Updated service references

4. Module Exports:
   - Created: `task-editor-container/index.ts` - Barrel file for exports

## Benefits of the Change

1. **Improved Focus**: The overlay with backdrop focuses user attention on the task being edited
2. **Better Space Utilization**: Centered overlay makes better use of screen real estate
3. **Better Mobile Experience**: Overlay approach is more adaptable to different screen sizes
4. **Clearer Purpose**: Name change from "Sidebar" to "TaskEditorContainer" better describes its function
5. **Component Isolation**: Better separation of concerns between task editing and navigation

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding a close button to the overlay for easier dismissal
2. Add escape key functionality to close the overlay
3. Implement focus trapping within the overlay for better keyboard accessibility
