## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

1. **DiaryEditorComponent**

   - Manages the diary entry creation/editing interface
   - Handles keyboard navigation
   - Manages state transitions between emoticon/tag/text input

2. **DiaryService**
   - Manages application state using signals
   - Handles API communication
   - Maintains emoticon and tag collections

### Backend Components

1. **DiaryEntry Entity**

   ```java
   @Entity
   @Table(name = "diary_entry")
   public class DiaryEntry {
       Long id
       Long userId
       String content
       String emoticon
       Set<String> tags
       Instant createdDate
       Instant lastModifiedDate
   }
   ```

2. **Database Schema**

   - diary_entry table
   - diary_entry_tags table (for tag collection)
   - Indexes on userId and createdDate

3. **REST API Endpoints**
   ```
   POST   /api/diary-entries      # Create entry
   PUT    /api/diary-entries/{id} # Update entry
   GET    /api/diary-entries      # Get all entries (paginated)
   GET    /api/diary-entries/{id} # Get single entry
   DELETE /api/diary-entries/{id} # Delete entry
   ```

## Security

### Authentication

- All diary operations require authentication
- Entries are user-specific
- Users can only access their own entries

### Data Validation

- Content length: 4000 characters max
- Required fields: content, emoticon, at least one tag
- User ID validation on all operations
- XSS protection on content

## User Experience

### Navigation Flow

1. Click "New Entry" or keyboard shortcut
2. Select emoticon (keyboard 1-9 or click)
3. Select tags (keyboard navigation or click)
4. Enter text content
5. Save with Cmd+Enter or click Save

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- 1-9: Select emoticon
- Enter/Right Arrow: Progress to next step
- Escape/Left Arrow: Go back/close
- Cmd+Enter: Save entry
- Tab: Navigate between elements

### Error Handling

- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Graceful handling of network errors
- Auto-save support for content
- Confirmation for destructive actions

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend

- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient state management with signals
- Debounced search/filter operations
- Optimized rendering with change detection

### Backend

- Pagination for entry lists
- Indexed queries for fast retrieval
- Efficient tag storage and querying
- Proper caching headers
