# Quick Idea Feature

## Overview

The Quick Idea feature provides users with a non-intrusive way to capture thoughts and ideas from anywhere within the application without losing their current context. It allows users to quickly jot down ideas that come to mind while working on other tasks, ensuring valuable insights aren't lost while minimizing workflow disruption.

## User Story

As a user working within the application, I want to be able to quickly capture ideas or thoughts that come to mind without having to navigate away from my current task, so that I don't lose valuable insights while maintaining my workflow and context.

## Feature Description

The Quick Idea feature is accessible from anywhere in the application and provides a simple, focused interface for capturing ideas with minimal disruption to the user's current workflow.

### Functionality

1. **Accessibility**

   - Available from the main navigation bar
   - Accessible via keyboard shortcut (⌘I / Ctrl+I)
   - Consistent availability across all application screens

2. **Idea Capture**

   - Overlay with focused text input
   - Minimal UI to reduce distraction
   - Quick save and dismiss options

3. **Interaction**

   - Open/close via button click or keyboard shortcut
   - Save ideas with Enter key or ⌘Enter
   - Dismiss without saving using Escape key
   - Click outside the input area to dismiss

4. **Data Management**
   - Ideas are saved to the user's account
   - Accessible later through the Ideas section
   - Timestamp recorded for reference

## User Interface

### Components

1. **Quick Idea Button**

   - Located in the main navigation bar
   - Icon: lightbulb
   - Text: "Quick Idea (⌘I)"
   - Hover state indicates clickability

2. **Idea Overlay**

   - Semi-transparent background overlay
   - Centered input container
   - Focused textarea with placeholder text
   - No additional UI elements to maintain focus

3. **Textarea**
   - Placeholder: "Type your idea here... (Press Enter or ⌘Enter to save, Escape to cancel)"
   - Auto-focus when overlay opens
   - Simple, clean design

## User Experience

### Workflow

1. User is working within any part of the application
2. User has a sudden idea or thought they want to capture
3. User activates Quick Idea feature via button or keyboard shortcut (⌘I)
4. Overlay appears with focused textarea
5. User types their idea
6. User saves (Enter/⌘Enter) or cancels (Escape/click outside)
7. Overlay disappears, returning user to their previous context
8. Saved idea is stored for later reference

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **⌘I / Ctrl+I**: Open/close Quick Idea overlay
- **Enter / ⌘Enter**: Save idea and close overlay
- **Escape**: Cancel and close overlay without saving

## Technical Implementation

### Components

- **QuickIdeaComponent**: Standalone Angular component
- **IdeaService**: Service for saving and retrieving ideas

### Key Methods

- `toggleOverlay()`: Opens/closes the idea input overlay
- `handleKeyboardEvent()`: Manages global keyboard shortcuts
- `saveIdea()`: Persists the idea to the backend
- `onKeyDown()`: Handles keyboard interactions within the textarea

### State Management

- Uses Angular signals for reactive state management
- `isOpen` signal controls overlay visibility
- Content state is managed locally within the component

### Event Handling

- Global keyboard event listener for shortcuts
- Proper event propagation management
- Cleanup on component destruction

## Security Considerations

- Ideas are associated with the authenticated user
- No sensitive data is collected
- Standard XSS protection for user input

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigable
- Focus management for screen readers
- Visual indicators for interactive elements
- Escape key support for dismissal

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rich Text Support**

   - Allow basic formatting of ideas
   - Support for links and code snippets

2. **Categorization**

   - Add tags or categories to ideas when capturing
   - Quick categorization options

3. **Voice Input**

   - Support for dictating ideas
   - Automatic transcription

4. **Context Awareness**

   - Automatically tag ideas based on current application context
   - Link ideas to relevant projects or boards

5. **Sharing**
   - Quick share options for collaborative environments
   - Export capabilities

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for component functionality
- Integration tests for service interactions
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing for overlay rendering

## Metrics & Analytics

- Frequency of Quick Idea usage
- Average idea length
- Conversion rate (ideas that lead to tasks/projects)
- Time saved compared to traditional capture methods
