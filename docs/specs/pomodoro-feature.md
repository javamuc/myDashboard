# Pomodoro Timer Feature

## Overview

The Pomodoro Timer feature provides users with a customizable time management tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. It enables users to work in focused intervals (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks, helping to improve productivity and maintain concentration. The feature includes customizable work and break durations, repeatable cycles, and savable profiles for different work scenarios.

## User Experience

### Workflow

1. **Starting a Pomodoro Session**

   - User selects a profile or configures timer settings
   - User clicks "Start Timer"
   - Timer begins countdown for work period
   - Visual indicators show work mode is active

2. **Transitioning to Break**

   - When work timer completes, break timer automatically starts
   - Visual indicators change to show break mode
   - Background color changes to red
   - Break timer becomes prominent

3. **Completing a Cycle**

   - After break timer completes, work timer restarts
   - Cycle count increments
   - Process repeats until configured number of cycles is reached
   - For indefinite repetition (count = 0), cycles continue until manually reset

4. **Customizing Settings**
   - User clicks settings icon
   - Settings panel appears with flip animation
   - User adjusts work/break times and repeat settings
   - User can save settings to a profile or apply without saving

## Technical Implementation

### Components

1. **PomodoroComponent**

   - Main component managing timer display and controls
   - Handles timer state and transitions
   - Manages profile selection
   - Controls flip animation to settings

2. **PomodoroSettingsComponent**

   - Manages timer configuration interface
   - Handles profile selection and editing
   - Provides time input controls
   - Manages repeat settings

3. **PomodoroStateService**
   - Manages timer state across components
   - Stores and retrieves profiles
   - Handles settings persistence
   - Manages active timer type

### Data Model

1. **PomodoroProfile**

   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `name`: Profile name
   - `workTime`: Work duration in seconds
   - `breakTime`: Break duration in seconds
   - `repeatEnabled`: Whether cycles repeat
   - `repeatCount`: Number of cycles (0 for indefinite)

2. **PomodoroSettings**

   - `workTime`: Work duration in seconds
   - `breakTime`: Break duration in seconds
   - `repeatEnabled`: Whether cycles repeat
   - `repeatCount`: Number of cycles
   - `activeProfileId`: Currently selected profile ID

3. **TimerType Enum**
   - `WORK`: Work timer mode
   - `BREAK`: Break timer mode

### State Management

- Uses Angular signals for reactive state management
- Persists settings and profiles in localStorage
- Uses BehaviorSubject for observable state changes
- Implements proper cleanup with takeUntilDestroyed

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigable interface
- High contrast visual indicators
- Clear visual feedback for timer states
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sound Notifications**

   - Audio alerts for timer completion
   - Customizable notification sounds
   - Volume control

2. **Task Integration**

   - Associate Pomodoro sessions with tasks
   - Track time spent on specific tasks
   - Integration with task management features

3. **Statistics and Analytics**

   - Track completed Pomodoro sessions
   - Visualize productivity patterns
   - Daily/weekly/monthly summaries

4. **Advanced Customization**

   - Long break options after multiple cycles
   - Auto-start options
   - Custom background colors/themes

5. **Mobile Notifications**
   - Push notifications for timer events
   - Background timer functionality

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for timer logic
- Component tests for UI behavior
- Service tests for state management
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Accessibility testing

## Metrics & Analytics

- Number of completed Pomodoro sessions
- Average session duration
- Most used profiles
