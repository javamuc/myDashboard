## Critical Security Issues to Address

1. **Account Lockout**: No evidence of account lockout mechanism was found. Implementing account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts would help prevent brute force attacks. **IMPLEMENTED**

2. **Rate Limiting**: No evidence of API rate limiting was found. Implementing rate limiting would help prevent abuse and denial of service attacks. **IMPLEMENTED**

3. **Sensitive Data Encryption**: Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest in the database for additional protection.

4. **Security Testing**: Conduct thorough security testing including penetration testing and automated security scanning before the beta launch.

## Rate Limiting

- [x] Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
  - Implemented using bucket4j-spring-boot-starter
  - General API rate limiting: 20 requests per minute per IP address
  - Authentication endpoint: 5 requests per minute per IP address
  - Configurable via application properties with different settings for dev and prod environments
  - Returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) with a JSON error message when limit is exceeded

## Clickjacking Protection

- [x] Prevent the application from being displayed in iframes
  - Implemented X-Frame-Options: DENY header in SecurityConfiguration.java
  - Added frame-ancestors 'none' directive to Content Security Policy
  - Applied consistently across all environments (dev, prod)
  - Protects against clickjacking attacks where attackers embed your site in an iframe
