# Kanban Board features with collaboration

## Must-Have Features:

These features are absolutely crucial for a functional and collaborative Kanban board. Without these, the board would be either unusable for collaboration or not function as a basic Kanban system.

### [x] Visual Board with Columns:

A clear visual representation of the workflow with columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done, or custom stages as needed by the project). This is the fundamental structure of a Kanban board.

### [x] Cards representing tasks:

The ability to create cards that represent individual tasks or work items. These cards are moved through the columns as work progresses.

### [x] Drag and Drop Functionality:

Users must be able to easily move cards between columns by dragging and dropping them. This visual movement represents the change in task status and is core to Kanban's workflow management.

### [x] Create and Edit Cards:

Users need to be able to create new task cards and edit existing ones. This includes adding titles, descriptions, and other necessary details to the tasks.

### [] Shared Board Access for Multiple Users:

Essential for collaboration. Multiple team members must be able to access the same Kanban board to view, interact with, and update tasks.

### [] Real-time Updates:

Changes made by one user should be instantly visible to all other users on the board. This ensures everyone is working with the most up-to-date information and avoids conflicts.

### [] User Assignment to Tasks:

The ability to assign tasks to specific users or teams. This clarifies responsibilities and ensures accountability for each task.

### [] Comments on Cards:

A communication feature within each task card where users can leave comments, ask questions, provide updates, and have discussions related to the specific task. This centralizes communication about the task.

### [] User Accounts and Roles:

A system to manage users with different access levels (e.g., Admin, Member, Viewer). This controls who can make changes and manage the board.

### [x] Task Descriptions/Details:

A dedicated space within each card to add more detailed information about the task, requirements, acceptance criteria, or any other relevant context.

### [] Notifications:

A system to notify users of important updates, such as when they are assigned to a task, when a task they are following is updated, or when they are mentioned in a comment. This keeps team members informed without needing constant manual checks.

## Nice-to-Have Features:

These features enhance the user experience, improve efficiency, and provide more advanced functionalities, but are not strictly necessary for a basic collaborative Kanban board to function.

### [] Mentions (@user) in Comments:

The ability to mention specific users within comments to directly notify them and draw their attention to a particular point or question.

### [] Activity Log:

A history of all changes and actions taken on the board and individual cards. This is useful for tracking progress, auditing changes, and understanding the flow of work.

### [x] Task Prioritization:

Features to prioritize tasks, such as priority levels (High, Medium, Low) or a system for ranking tasks within columns.

### [x] Due Dates/Deadlines:

The ability to set due dates or deadlines for tasks, helping with time management and ensuring timely completion of work.

### [] File Attachments:

The option to attach files directly to task cards. This allows for easy sharing of relevant documents, images, or other resources related to the task.

### [] Checklists within Cards:

The ability to add checklists within task cards to break down larger tasks into smaller sub-tasks and track their completion.

### [x] Tags/Labels:

A system to categorize and tag cards with labels. This can help in filtering, searching, and visually organizing tasks based on category, project, or other criteria.

### [x] Search Functionality:

A search feature to quickly find specific tasks based on keywords in titles, descriptions, comments, or other card details.

### [] Swimlanes:

Horizontal lanes on the Kanban board to further visually separate and categorize tasks (e.g., by team, project, or priority level within columns).

### [x] Work In Progress (WIP) Limits:

The ability to set limits on the number of cards that can be in each column simultaneously. This helps to manage workflow, prevent bottlenecks, and encourage focus on completing tasks.

### [] Reporting/Analytics:

Basic reporting features or analytics to track metrics like cycle time, lead time, throughput, and identify areas for process improvement.

### [] Customizable Columns:

The ability to customize the names and types of columns to better match the specific workflow of a project or team.

### [] Card Colors:

Options to use different colors for cards to visually categorize or highlight tasks based on type, priority, or other criteria.

### [] Subtasks:

The ability to break down a task card into smaller, manageable subtasks that can be tracked within the main task.

### [] Dependencies:

Features to link tasks and define dependencies (e.g., Task B cannot start until Task A is completed).

### [] Time Tracking:

A feature to track the time spent on tasks, which can be useful for project management, resource allocation, and understanding task durations.

### [] Integrations with Other Tools:

Integration capabilities with other productivity or project management tools like calendar apps, communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams), or file storage services.

### [] Custom Fields:

The ability to add custom fields to task cards to capture specific data relevant to the project or workflow beyond the standard fields.

### [] Recurring Tasks:

Functionality to set up tasks that automatically recur on a set schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

### [] Burndown Charts/Advanced Analytics:

More advanced reporting and analytics, such as burndown charts to visualize progress and predict completion, or more detailed performance reports.

### [] Guest Access:

The ability to invite external collaborators or clients to view or interact with the board with limited permissions.

### [] Mobile App Access:

A mobile application to access and manage the Kanban board from smartphones or tablets, enhancing accessibility and flexibility.
