"1501","Quick idea feature description","I want a new feature to quickly persist a distracting thought or idea so I can continue concentrating on my current task. For this I want a new component, centered in the navigation bar. This component has a button, which can also be triggered with 'cmd+i', which opens a textarea overlay, below the button, where I can then enter my idea or thought. Closing this overlay with 'Escape' or 'Enter' or 'Cmd+Enter' saves the idea in the database in a new table called ideas. ","2025-01-27 12:23:54.706619","2025-01-27 13:03:14.245902","2"
